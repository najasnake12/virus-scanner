# Virus Scanner

This script scans for almost 1 million different malware signatures! (Meaning that it detects almost 1 million different viruses)
A simple yet excellent tool for finding viruses in a selected folder!

Since the virushashes.txt file is so big I recommend cloning this repository and then opening the virushashes.txt file and copy pasting it.
My PC is pretty powerful and it couldn't handle it!
